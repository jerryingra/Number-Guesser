### Project Description
In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of the terminal, and you can use your browser’s console to help you test your functions and view any syntax errors.

### How to Play
Pick a number between 0-9. Try and guess a number that will be closest to the mystery number. The number that is closest wins the round. Hit 'next round' to play again. 

### Credits
